    <h2 class="heading">About Netflix</h2>
    <p>Netflix, Inc. is an American over-the-top content platform and production company headquartered in Los Gatos, California. Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. The company's primary business is a subscription-based streaming service offering online streaming from a library of films and television series, including those produced in-house. In April 2021, Netflix had 208 million subscribers, including 74 million in the United States and Canada. It is available worldwide except in mainland China, Syria, North Korea, and Crimea. The company has offices in Canada, France, Brazil, the Netherlands, India, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. Netflix is a member of the Motion Picture Association, producing and distributing content from countries all over the globe. Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental by mail, but Hastings abandoned the sales about a year after the company's founding to focus on the initial DVD rental business. Netflix expanded its business in 2007 with the introduction of streaming media while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental business.</p>
